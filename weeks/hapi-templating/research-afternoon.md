# Research afternoon

## Validation

1. Research what data validation is, and how it can be implemented in hapi.
2. Create a basic hapi project, in which you use `Joi` to validate that the user-provided e-mail and password are of the correct format.

## Authentication

1. Research what authentication is, and how they it can be implemented in hapi. Further research what password hashing is, and how it can help to keep your application secure.
2. Create a basic hapi project, in which you use `Bcrypt` to hash stored passwords, and use `hapi-auth-basic` to authenticate a user based on the provided password.

## Cookies and caching

1. Research what cookies are, and how they can be used to remember stateful information.
2. Research what caching is, and why is it important for your application's performance.

_Note: we will have a walk-through on how to implement cookies in hapi later this week._

## Templating with helper functions

1. Research what helper functions in handlebars are, and how they can be implemented in Handlebars.
2. Create a basic hapi project with Handlebars templating, in which you use at least one in-built Handlebars helper function and one custom helper function.
