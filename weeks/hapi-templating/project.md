## Project

Blog site with CMS (content management system)

### Task
- Build a blog with a CMS (content management system) using the Hapi.js framework!
- Use a postgreSQL database to store and retrieve your data.
- Use the retrieved data to populate a handlebars template for _server-side_ rendering to be displayed on the front-end.


### Goals

The primary aim of this project is to get comfortable with setting up a hapi server and to discover the awesomeness of handlebars.js! Spend time considering how to format your helper functions, layouts, partials and views.


What's also important:

- Use the hapi-auth-cookie module for session management with [cookies](https://github.com/SavageWilliam/hapi-auth-cookie-ws)
- Use the `server.inject` method to test your server
- Aim for as high code coverage as possible, on front-end and back-end
- Try to use basic ES6 syntax
- Host both your website and your database on Heroku
