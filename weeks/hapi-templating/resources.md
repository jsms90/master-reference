## Resources

Hapi is a big framework, we don't expect you to learn all of it in a week!

Here are some resources to get you started:

* [Hapi.js website](http://hapijs.com/tutorials) - these are a fantastic set of tutorials. _Getting started_ tutorial specifically is a great one page walkthrough of setting up a server. The _Routing_ tutorial is a good one to move onto.

* [Dwyl learn Hapi](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-hapi) - Dwyl's repo on Hapi (has a brilliant set of further resources).

* [Introduction to Node Servers with Hapi](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-node-servers-with-hapi-js) - these are some eggheads tutorials on Hapi.

* [Hapi.js API docs](https://hapijs.com/api) - We recommend starting by looking at the Hapi.js tutorial, but for further information on different elements, checkout their api docs.
