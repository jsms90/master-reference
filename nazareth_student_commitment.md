## Founders & Coders Nazareth Student Commitment

#### Student Commitment

Founders & Coders is a not-for-profit endeavour whose main purpose is to provide study and training programmes for the general public and to provide workspace for its students and graduates.

Founders & Coders was founded on the principle of reciprocity. This means that we do not charge you tuition fees, but we do expect you to contribute back to the viability and development of the programme, in particular by mentoring future cohorts for at least two weeks of the following course. When you pursue full-time work, we expect you to consider working for one of our employment partners in the UK or Israel (link to list of employers).

#### Code of Conduct

All members of Founders & Coders are required to agree with our [code of conduct](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

#### Professionalism

By participating in Founders & Coders, you are making a 16-week, full-time commitment of your time and energy to ensure your success on the programme. Your attendance affects not only you, but also your team, your cohort, and the entire community. This includes being ready to work each day at the start time of your programme, and staying until the programme concludes each day.

Unprofessional behavior negatively impacts the entire community and may be grounds for removal from Founders & Coders. If you cannot attend any part of the course for any reason, you are expected to notify your cohort beforehand by posting on your Gitter channel, with as much notice as possible.
