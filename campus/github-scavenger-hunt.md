## GitHub Scavenger Hunt

From our curriculum to the running of our campuses, at Founders and Coders we track all our discussions and decision making via GitHub. By using GitHub as our single source of truth, we reduce the cognitive overload that's involved when constantly switching between mediums of communication.

We aim for transparency in the running of the organisation, to enable the greatest level of contribution from our members. In order to get involved, you will need to get acquainted with our GitHub repos.
