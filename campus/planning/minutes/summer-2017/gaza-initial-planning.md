## Gaza - Summer Cohort Curriculum Planning 2017

### Suggestions for next course:

#### Technical skills:
- more complex projects (react etc)
- functional programming. what are pure functions, mutating variables, map vs for loop
- ES6: started using es6 at week 5, but it should be from the beginning/earlier in the course.
- promises
- more time on callbacks
- api design, REST, sending and receiving JSON
- more testing, and advanced testing methods such as, mocking, nock, postgres testing
- more git commands. maybe learn a new git/github skill every week.
- more vanilla node resources

#### Other skills:
- more on how to make user stories, and scoping out the project before you start
- how to do code review. goals and techniques. is it useful to have beginners reviewing the code of other beginners?
- more agile training and project management, wireframes etc

#### Organisational:
- ping/ponging should be enforced more in pair programming
- each week should utilise topics from the previous week
- single person full stack projects. mixed opinions.
- anonymous feedback on curriculum and group dynamics + office hours
- change groups every week
- team leadership - each team could have a project manager for the week, for delegating tasks, and leading meetings
- more sessions from external mentors. (video calls maybe)
