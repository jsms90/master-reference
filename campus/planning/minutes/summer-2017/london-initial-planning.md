# Curriculum planning
## Day 1, Monday 15th May

### No more research afternoon?

* Feel like an inefficient way to learn things, don’t take things in
* Learn from own research, don’t learn from others’ research
* Size of topics make it work or not work
* Big topics —> too much; Small topics —> hard to fill the time (waste of time?)
* Relying on other people for the important information we need to learn
* A few hours isn’t enough time to learn something and present it back
* Website aren’t necessary good —> need to know what resources are good and what are bad
* We should work on having really good resources / bank of resources we can contribute to
* One person always loses out because one topic is something you’ve done so there’s not much more to learn
* Didn’t always use research in projects
* Learning to learn things —> missing explicit guidance on how best to research things, the art of googling (a lot of asking irrelevant questions on google)
* How do we know what is good information and what is not?
* If we have to use what we’ve learnt in this project, that would be good —> we learn by doing

* Baseline —> agree whether getting rid of READMEs is a good idea, work towards thinking what should replace it. Lots of research topics are interesting and relevant. Cut down what research topics are to what’s most relevant. Get rid of irrelevant things?
* Get rid of it and try something else?

* Later today we will group things together and people who feel strongly will come to a consensus about what to do.

* Liked researching, but not getting info from others.

* Contributing to centralised set of READMEs?
* Learning how to learn is the most important thing
* Workshop on using the internet as your tool. Researching in order to figure out how to fix your code. Using stack overflow
* Research afternoon would be much more efficient if there was a workshop on how to learn, how to research well, having the techniques for researching coding
* If there is something that you need for the project, have a tech spike, code something
* What are the learning outcomes for research afternoon -> learning to google, learning something specific for your project - what are the aims, how do we fulfil them?

* FAC9 - same conversation (almost same positives and negatives), no one thinks it works but difficult to come up with a solution

* Part of it is about delivering a presentation, conveying tech info, workshop on how to present tech info, how to condense information and make it meaningful. Improve what the rest of the cohort gets from the presentations.

* Loads of good tech talks on this (The myth of the real js developer). Find resources on good presentations.

### Testing

* Difference between different environments, e.g. test, production
* Testing databases
* Sinon
* Feedback on tests that we’ve written
* Testing week —> testing was presented fairly simply but we when came to it, it was very complicated
* No QUnit, not relevant after that week, probably not going to use it again? Don’t think QUnit set us up very well for future testing. Better to learn something that we’ll use.
QUnit - introduce us to testing concepts.
* Confuses you about testing the DOM. (i.e. DOM manipulation is just testing the DOM api, so no need to test the DOM)
* More info on what we should test, why we should test it. Better understanding of pure functions.
* All projects after API week are back-end, so we don’t need to use front-end tests

* Context around why you’re learning things, where testing is valuable and where it’s not. Why am I learning this technology?

* Walk through on how to develop something using TDD, rather than going straight from FizzBuzz to roman numerals, stopwatch
* For e.g. roman numerals, if you hadn’t done the algorithm before, quite difficult to know what end point you’re aiming for.
* Code along for something real? An example of where this is useful and how to implement it, an actual thing, not a kata. Something that demonstrates what testing is for, i.e. like Steve’s ES6 workshop, have tests running, change the code and see tests break

* Better intro to async testing. First async thing we did was waterfall. Possible that people have done no async code previously. Not go straight in with waterfall as the first async thing. Do a simpler async thing before introducing waterfall.
* Introduction to callbacks earlier on.

* Testing week - To do list from Nazareth with some pre-written code received positive feedback.

### React

* Really useful thing to do, lots of people use it, good to learn the way to write code
* Learn the way that React does coding - paradigm shift in how coding is done
* Want to be as employable as possible, lot of jobs ask for React
* Add some React each week? Would depend on how much experience everyone had in it
React - doing all of it in the front-end, no back-end, counter to what FAC teaches?
* Way FAC structures learning is good, easier than learning by ourselves
* More helpful that the course teaches you what matters at that point e.g. for employability. Important that graduates can do what employers are looking for
* Isn’t that much to learn to get started. More and more things are happening in the browser, FAC focusses on server-side. Common to render views in browser (wider discussion?)
* FAC8 had React, replaced it with UX. One of the core problems was the way in which React was taught, i.e. 16 person project?!
* If there was the option to learn it, would learn it. Being here, we are learning how to learn. If React is not taught, people who want to learn it will learn it.
* Intro to React, how to get set up. Might be nice to have a foundation in it. Do something in a day, teach what problems React is solving. i.e. build something in vanilla javascript, then using React and see how it’s helpful.

* React - going against frameworks? But, good to know about the paradigm shift and what’s going on in the industry.
* But, FAC is about learning how to learn.
* Course is very back-end focussed. Not much front-end, why teach React when CSS skills aren’t up to scratch.
* Shift is towards front-end, we should dedicate more to front-end.


### Workshops across the course

* Peer review tested workshops with solutions
* Some really good, some less structured. Always have solutions.
* Make sure that before we introduce a workshop, make sure it works, check for errors
* More coding along
* Error handling

* User testing each other’s workshops —> need a process for making sure this happens. Last day of curriculum planning, give workshops to other pairs to test that it works and is useful.

* Code along - requires testing as person delivering will have to know that it works.
* A couple of people don’t like code alongs.
* Code alongs are good but would be useful to see a before and after, with completed, correct solutions.
* Level of accountability for workshop. Make sure that workshop is maintained. Owner needs to make sure it is maintained, passed on to someone else if necessary, README is clear, etc.
* Accountability of mentors in general —> need to be there and be helpful.
* Plan to user test workshops at the end of the week
* Error handling - wasn’t always clear what proper error handling meant, could be more on that. Intro on how to approach it.
* Ongoing error handling —> always be checking that errors are being handled
* Make sure that feedback is sent back to the DOM telling the user that there’s an error.
* Expand on Nick’s workshop?
* When should it be introduced? Add error handling to the specification for the project? A little more emphasis in all projects, i.e. show us what happens when your project breaks.

* User test every project?
* Code review does cover this in a way, do get feedback about how it’s intuitive
* Projects aren’t generally ready for user testing
* Point of the project is to implement certain technologies - everything can’t be perfect, can’t integrate everything into a two-day project
* Strange to make projects for 8 weeks and not have any polished project. Start with a semi-complete project, polish and finish it? Basic functionality is there, bring it from that to the finished product.
* More of an emphasis on UX in week 1 with accessibility. Introduce idea of UX in the first week (not go into loads of detail, but introduce concept, not full on design sprint)
* Lot of back-end focus —> "don’t worry about how it looks”. Need to tie it all together with user experience
* How it ties in to user stories in github etc.
* Revamp git workshop to be git and github, explain how to do project, user stories etc.

(Entire course is done in agile?! Proper sprints, designs, user testing)

### Pre course material

* More emphasis on what’s important

* More back-end - pre-course was very front-end focussed, would be useful to have some back-end as it’s completely unknown to some people.
* Introduce e.g. package.json

* Why are we a full-stack course if most is back-end and only the pre-course is front-end?

* Choose resources wisely, intro to back-end? But need to make sure it’s not too confusing and doesn’t make things worse

* Expectation management —> let people know what to expect from the course, in terms of front and back end

* Should be a short list of things that you have to do —> this stuff should be assumed knowledge
If you want to work on some other things beforehand, offer some resources but say that it won’t be assumed knowledge

* Is pre-course something we do because we won’t be doing it on the course, or an intro to the level that we need to be at and we will continue it on the course?
* Better communication —> tell people that they might not understand right now
* Nothing should be introduced that we won’t go over again?

* Shouldn’t necessarily be introduced on GitHub, especially for people who have never really used GitHub before
* Language is important, we should say what should be done i.e. If you don’t know this, you are going to be behind

* Some sort of intro to back-end?

* For front-end, writing good HTML and CSS is very important

* Weekend reading?

### Project teams

* Ensure that everyone in the team is involved and understanding the code

* More of an emphasis on going through the code as a team so that everyone understands it
* Explain early on that teams should always share what they’ve done and that everyone in the team understands everything
* Mixed abilities - difficult to understand and share sometimes

* Nazareth — big difference in people’s abilities, certain people didn’t always understand

* Important skill to be able to understand other people’s code

* When it’s something that only one or two people know, everyone should sit down and figure it out together, go through together

* Focus on integrating everyone understanding the code into project, make part of the flow?

### Code review quality

* Code review is useful, but could be more useful. Maybe need someone to look at the whole code base
* Issues should be relevant to what we are trying to implement that week?
* Checklist for code review, need some guidelines on what to review i.e. checklist based on learning outcomes for the week?
* Relying on knowledge of reviewer

### Lightning talks

* Discuss a way to show non-coding related knowledge
* I.e. interesting things from people’s past lives, 15 minute talks
* Integrate this into weekly stop go continue? Takes a long time to prepare something.
* Enforcing it is not ideal, being forced to do an interesting talk is not helpful.
* Open slot where people are encouraged to talk.
* Find a way so that people don’t feel pressured to talk i.e. more of a q&a thing using Nelson’s game

* Restorative practices - resolve conflicts

* What’s the aim? Sharing useful knowledge
* Should it be within course time or not?
* FAC is a place where people come to learn
* Show and tell —> previous cohorts showed anything interested they’d learned over the weekend (people didn’t tend to keep to it though)

**Solution?**
* People anonymously make suggestions (could be about anything), group decides what would be useful to hear about by voting.
* Talks are organised for sometime during the course, maybe after 6?

* Do an ice breaker at first stop go continue


### CSS

* Lots of things we build are functional but don’t look good

* CSS often gets left to one person who is good at it / likes it

* Suggest bits of CSS to add for each project
* Could be a requirement for one or two projects e.g. some sort of layout etc.
* If we can afford to have it as a whole week, we should

* Is adding a bit of css into morning challenges, into projects going to solve the problem?

* For projects, initially templates could be given and projects would build on them

* Teaching how to build a layout, box model, etc.
* Best practice for CSS? How you structure CSS so that it’s maintainable

**Solution?**
* A whole week on HTML and CSS? Or Fit it in throughout the course?
* Collate resources on style guides, best practice etc.

* Noga, Sophia and Nick —> speak to them about how to take this forward


### More of a push to explore different technologies during project weeks (not teaching weeks)

* No frameworks culture sometimes leads to hesitation to use new things
* New things are not scary and we shouldn’t be afraid as we will have to do this in jobs anyway
* React was heavily discouraged for reading week - should be a bit more open
* What is the purpose of those projects? Decide how much to encourage / discourage frameworks
* We shouldn’t be coming out of a bootcamp with a hesitation to explore new things / libraries etc.
* The way it is phrased should not be like it was with us i.e. don’t learn React. Should be up to us what we want to learn


### Bank of best resources

* Create some sort of repo where we bring all articles, online courses, meetup info into one place
* Where do we put this? GitHub? Google doc?
* People have different learning styles, good to have links from different people
* (Resource sharing repo https://github.com/foundersandcoders/resource-sharing)


### Express vs Hapi

* Very difficult to find resources for Hapi e.g. postgres with Hapi, where postgres with Express is easier to find info on
* Both do the same, why not learn the one that has all the resources, larger community to support it
* Doesn’t seem to be a Hapi community
* Express seems really nice and clean
* We were never really given a good reason why we use Hapi, other than we’ll probably learn Express anyway so might as well learn Hapi
* If you’re new to development and there’s an agenda behind why we’re using something, we should be told
We chose this as an organisation because of x, y and z

* If everyone thinks we should do Express, we should propose it as an alternative, then those in favour of Hapi will have to justify why we have to use it (in a consensus based system, members should vote on what we choose)
Dwyl repo says why hapi, not hapi vs express

* Who decides on curriculum? Consensus based decision from cohort and people in the space who are involved. We are the people building the curriculum so we should be involved in decisions.

* We should come up with proposals and then bring them to another meeting to discuss?
* There needs to be a way for our community to develop the curriculum together, not just the previous cohort, so we can’t just make all the decisions on our own. People who actively participate, consistently, should make up the curriculum committee. Can’t just have cohorts make decisions, then the next cohort overturn it.

### ES6
* Mostly compatible everywhere now, so we should be taught / use it?
* Taught Babel as well so that we can compile back
* Shouldn't get too far away from fundamentals though

* Proposal to use ES6 as it’s mostly compatible everywhere and make sure that we also teach Babel so that we are covered for wherever things aren’t compatible
