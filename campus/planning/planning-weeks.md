# Planning curriculum weeks

The following is a workflow mentors may use during their initial curriculum planning team meeting when designing their weeks. It is a work in progress.

Assign someone to take minutes for this meeting. At the end of this meeting aim to write-up in your assigned issue for review:

* A list of proposed learning outcomes for the week.
* A proposal for the group project.
* A broad proposal for the [week structure](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/27#issuecomment-267200575): what topics will be covered and in what slots. If you know specific resources you'll use then include them, otherwise just outline the scope of what you want slots in the schedule to cover.

Aim to have evenly distributed responsibilities for each mentor to carry out post-meeting and document them in the issue.

### Workflow

**Discuss and write-up a list of the learning outcomes for your week.**

What is your week's overall theme -- what topics & technologies is it broken down into that students will learn throughout the week? What key concepts do you want them to understand or be familiar with?

Draw up a list and if in doubt keep filtering down to what you agree to be the core learning outcomes - the highest priority, _minimum_ requirements that you expect _every_ student team will be able to accomplish.

Those of the lowest priority are your likely candidates for stretch goals in the event of a tight schedule.

_You can use the outline of your week in the [curriculum overview](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/general/curriculum-overview.md) as a starting point. You may also wish to consider looking at the learning outcomes for your week from our past curriculums for ideas. They can be found on the F&C organisation's [gitbook page](https://www.gitbook.com/@foundersandcoders)._

**Come up with a project idea that fulfils as many of the core learning outcomes as possible.**

The project is the most important learning experience of the week, the opportunity to apply everything students have learned. You could think of Monday & Tuesday as preparation or build-up to the project, and the completion of the project as equal to the achievement of the core learning outcomes, so that students end the week on a moment of closure.

If students don't get to or are not expected to apply topics or technologies you introduced to them in their project, you have to ask, with such a tight schedule, to what extent the topic is appropriately placed or the project well chosen.

_If you come into difficulties incorporating the topics listed under the [curriculum overview](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/general/curriculum-overview.md) for your week, ping one of our [reviewers](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and we can discuss whether it should be re-distributed._

**Break down what the student will need for the project into component topics and assign them to slots in the week structure with a scope of what will be covered.**

The week structure can be found [here](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/27#issuecomment-267200575) with the timings for workshops, morning challenges, research topics & external speaker slots to fill. Try to keep to the schedule as much as you can. Only negotiate if it significantly effects your week.

Think about whether a topic is suited to a research subject, external speaker talk, workshop or morning challenge, and remember that it's possible to cover multiple topics in one session if integrated well.

**Begin researching into ideas for the workshops & morning challenges you'll use.**

You should divide up to start looking into the following. If you don't finish this, keep calm! Just post the minutes of your meeting in the issue and your reviewer can help you find internal resources.

In order of priority:

1. **Internal resources:** identify from our archive of workshops & morning challenges how many could fit or be improved to fit the needs of your week structure and assign them to the slots. [Dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl) has a great archive of tutorials you should familiarise yourself with -- they're role models for what you could build yourself! You might also look at [this issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/43) or the course-books of our past curriculums [here](https://www.gitbook.com/@foundersandcoders).
2. **External resources:** research into what good resources there are online that suit your needs and if there are any that are appropriate assign them to the slots.
3. **New resources:** don't build anything from scratch unless it identifies an actual need. If there are gaps in your schedule you now know some _problem areas_ in our available resources. Aim to identify one gap that your team can focus on building a good resource for. Creating good resources is time intensive, so be wary of trying to do too much.

If you make use of any repos on github, internal or external, all mentors, please star them! You're making use of the contributor's time & effort, share the :heart: with them!

**Conclude the meeting by assigning yourselves to post-meeting responsibilities**

##### Making Pull-Requests

Folders for each week can be found inside the [coursebook](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/tree/master/coursebook) folder. Make commits on the files in your folder, commit against the [issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues) for your week, and follow our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If someone hasn't assigned themselves as a reviewer in your week's issue, you can assign your PRs to any of the reviewers listed in the guidelines. Let them review and approve your proposals, in the form of minutes from your meeting, in your week's issue before making PRs. They might know of resources that will fit your plans to save you the trouble of creating new ones.

##### Suggestions for responsibilities

Assign yourselves to the following responsibilities, and any others you can think of, to be done over the next few days, or in your own time:

* If you use any open-source github repos, read over them and raise issues if you see any areas for improvement your team can contribute to.
* Assign people to work on new resources you're creating. If you can't pair then be sure to review each other's work.
* Look into external speakers or alumni who can fill your week's external speaker slot. Think about what topics would be ideal for them to cover.
* Write-up the week structure, including specific timings for each day with links to the resources to be used in that slot, inside your folder's README file.
* Write-up the week's learning outcomes and revision key points in your folder's learning-outcomes file.
* Write-up a short summary & context on your week's theme to accompany the introduction at the start of the week, inside your folder's learning-outcomes file.
* Write-up a description of the project inside your folder's project file.
* Write-up a description of the tasks for the research afternoon inside your folder's research-afternoon file.
* Research into extra resources student's might find useful when revising and include them in your folder's resources file. Look into our past [coursebooks](https://www.gitbook.com/@foundersandcoders) for ideas.

Remember to make use of our alumni network in the space if you're stuck on anything. We've all mentored before and may be able to help out or give suggestions. :blush:
