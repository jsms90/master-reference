# Learn Elm & _Build_ Something _Useful_ for F&C (Week)

## Why?

We _asked_ the _people_ for their feedback, and it was _overwhelmingly_
in _favour_ of learning Elm.

> The [research question](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm/issues/10)
was _carefully_ constructed to be _unbiased_.
And we were _sure_ to keep our views on the subject _private_
while the poll was live: https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/issues/27
Friction to participate/vote in the _anonymous_ poll was _eliminated_
by using a twitter poll which requires a single-click to vote.
The response was 49 votes which is a **_statistically_ significant sample size**.
The _overwhelming_ conclusion is that people are _in favour_ of learning elm.

Now, if you want to _personally_ know why learning/using `elm-lang`
_instead_ (_or with_) JavaScrip is a _great_ idea,
please see: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm#why
and watch: [**6 Months of Elm in Production** talk](https://youtu.be/R2FtMbb-nLs?t=47m36s)
