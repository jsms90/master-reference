## Learning outcomes

### Elm Language & Platform (_Technical Skills_)

+ ***Why*** write Elm instead of "JavaScrip" web applications?
+ Learn the language syntax: http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax
+ Learn Elm Architecture: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/
and how knowing Redux (_from last week_) is _useful_ now.
+ Follow the guide and do all the examples _together_:
https://github.com/evancz/guide.elm-lang.org
+ Follow the "Frontend Masters" Elm Tutorials
because they are _hands-down_ the "_best_" fastest way to learn Elm.

### Giving Back to Open Source

Give back to the Open Source _community_
by Helping to Document the Elm-workshop videos!
https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop/issues/8 ...
_Yes_, this is an _easy way to give back_
but that does not make it any "_less valuable_" to the _communtiy_
because it **helps _complete_ beginners** get started with Elm!

+ ***Give back*** to Open Source Community by contributing
to @rtfeldman's Elm Workshop.
The _best_ way we know to help future members of our Community
(_F&C, Elm and the wider Web/Native App Development communities
  who all benefit from Elm's addoption!_) is to _enhance_
  the existing Elm Workshop by helping to _transcribe_ the videos:
https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop/issues/8 _Why_?
  + What's in it for me...? (_good question_!) _participation_ in the _wider_
  [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
  community which expands your own knowledge & understanding,
  your _technical_ "_social network_" and horizons in general!
  (_ask [Rafe](https://github.com/rjmk) how he "got good" at coding!!_)
  + help ***future learners*** _understand_ what they need to know
  so _they_ can _contribute_ to the projects you are about to start building!!
  + If you ever have a "_really hard_" problem to solve in Elm you can
  call on the Elm community and they will know that you are a "_member_" of the "_tribe_" and will rally round to help you when you need them!! `#PayItForward`

### "Final Project"

+ ***`after`*** you have given back
by helping to _transcribe_ the Elm-workshop videos,
it's time to _focus_ on the F&C Organization/Community
and _use_ your knowledge of Elm to make something _useful_ for F&C!
`GOTO`: [`project.md`](# 'please update this hyperlink')
+ "Learning outcome" for the "***Final Project***" is:
  + Learn how to ***prioritise*** the highest value features to the Org/User
  + **Work in a (_larger_) team** that includes both graduates of _previous_ F&C cohorts
  ***and*** involves the Directors/Mentors as "Product Owners" where appropriate.
  + Learn how to **document everything** to
  [***eliminate friction***](https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues/58)
  and "_barriers to participation_" for future team members.
  (_so far Docs have been an afterthought in all but a handful
    of F&C projects! this is a massive oversight as dramatically reduces
    the potential for collaboration because people don't know **how**
    to get started!_)
  + Have (_and leave behind_) a ***clear backlog*** of "ideas"
  for how the app _can_ be expanded/improved so there is a
  ["Next Action"](https://hamberg.no/gtd/)
  the person _after_ you can take to `continue` making progress
  towards the project's goal!
  + Ensure that all discussions are had/captured in the ***issues***
  for the project so there is a "Clear Decision Trail" that will allow
  someone `else` to pick up if for any reason you _leave_ the project
  mid-way through and _unable_ to `return`.
