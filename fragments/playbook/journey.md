##Developers at Founders & Coders
We have five kinds of developer at Founders & Coders.

+ Student
+ Graduate
+ Apprentice
+ Developer
+ Lead Developer

> It is important to note that this is a **technical distinction only**. Founders & Coders as an organisation has a completely flat hierarchy and all _members_ have equal say and voting rights.

**Student**    
 During the [8 week foundation course](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/playbook/blob/master/foundation.md), you are a _student_. You can't work on F&C client work but you can and _should_ dedicate your time to learning the material and asking as many questions as you can!

**Graduate**    
After completing the 8 week foundation course, you are officially a *graduate developer*. You can work on MVP projects and follow-up work for your **MVP clients**, internal projects and your own projects. Only once a student becomes an apprentice, can they be apprenticed to a developer, on a project-by-project basis.


**Apprentice**    
After completing an *apprentice panel*, you become an *apprentice developer*. Apprentices can join a *developer* as a **member of a two-person development team** and work on **all F&C client work** (non-MVPs as well as MVPs).

**Developer**        
After completing a *developer panel*, you become a *developer*. Developers can **take on an apprentice** and work on **all F&C client work** (non-MVPs as well as MVPs). Apprentice-developer teams will be expected to undertake regular (i.e. weekly) code reviews for other teams.

**Lead Developer**    
After completing a *lead developer panel*, you become a *Lead developer*. Lead developers can continue to pair with developers or apprentices but can also lend their expertise on an ad-hoc basis to other projects. [requires more detail]


## The Panel

To achieve each level, candidates will be expected to submit the following to the panel:

+ A **fully-documented repository** of a project or software module that you have worked on;
+ A **case study of a project** (for the F&C website), using our case study template;
+ A **teaching resource** in the form of a GitHub repository with an associated README;
+ An **accompanying blog post** for the F&C website;
+ A **screencast of the teaching resource** for the F&C YouTube channel (a colleague can do the voiceover, if preferred);
+ Demonstrate your contributions to colleagues' work, through a history of **issues raised on GitHub**;

In certain cases, alternatives to these requirements can be accepted as a panel submission, but this will need to be discussed with a member of the panel in advance.

Candidates will also verbally present their teaching resource (and reasons for their choice of subject) to the panel and answer a few short questions.

###The teaching resource
The teaching resource could take the form of a project "starter kit" for a project or some similar resource that could be used on the course or for a workshop, such as a full tutorial on a given subject. Please discuss your intended resource with a member of the panelbefore starting on it.

###What the panel will be looking for
+ Explanation of **Why** your chosen subject is important/interesting
+ **Provide context**: How does this fit into our existing body of knowledge? (any prerequisites?)
+ Use a logical structure;
+ Make it **beginner-friendly** (terminology and examples);
+ Include an associated repo with **example code that people can clone and play with**;
+ Explain **how to resolve problems** when things go wrong, not just a resource of when everything goes your way;
+ Split into **various steps where people can checkout a branch** in your repo at every step and play with the code you have set up.

###Before submitting to the panel
Candidates will consult with one of the panel members to ensure that they and their resources are ready for submission. Only once the panel member thinks the candidate is ready can the candidate submit to the panel.

The panel will all provide feedback in the form of GitHub issues (and face-to-face discussion). When the panel is satisfied with the quality of the material, the candidate must present both pieces to an open forum of members at which anyone may ask questions.  

###Further Notes
The process is the same for each level, but the level of craftsmanship required will be expected to be significantly higher for each successive level.

Some implications of these proposals:
+ Graduates can put themselves forward to be apprenticed only when they and the panel think they are ready;
+ There is a clearly-defined journey from less experienced to more experienced developer;
+ Everyone in F&C takes the quality of their work and their contribution to learning seriously;
+ We build up some high-quality open source learning materials that we and others can re-use.

## Why do this?
There are a few reasons you might want to progress through the levels:
+ **[Graduates and Apprentices]** Opportunity to pair with someone more experienced on projects
+ **[Developers and Lead developers]** Opportunity to pair with someone less experienced and become a mentor
+ **Improved developer reputation** - all of the materials you create for you panel will be used and publicised by Founders & Coders, providing a lot of exposure for your work (and hopefully a few starred repos ;))
+ **For Graduates**, taking the Apprentice panel also allows you to move away from working solely on MVPs and into fuller projects.

## FAQs  

*What happens to somebody who has finished the course, but is not yet an apprentice?*    
They are considered a graduate and can continue to work on MVPs, follow-up work for MVP clients, internal projects and their own projects.  

*What sorts of support will graduates get before they are apprentices?*    
 Less than we would like. They need to make sure that they are working together with other graduates and are regularly submitting their own work to peer review as well as peer reviewing other graduates' work.  

*What happens if somebody fails the panel submission?*    
This should never happen. It is the responsibility of the panel members to make sure a candidate is ready before they submit to the panel.  

*Where and when will the presentations take place?*    
Downstairs, possibly on Fridays, with drinks afterwards.  

*What is the point of the presentation?*    
It is a rite of passage. It is a reminder that we take the quality of our work and our teaching seriously. And it is something for students to aim for.

*Will there be a presentation every week?*    
With 16 new students every four months and apprentices graduating to developers, there will probably be at least one pass presentation per week and sometimes more.  

*Who is going to sit on the appointment panels?*    
For now, the panel consists of our two company directors, [Ines](https://twitter.com/iteles) and [Dan](https://twitter.com/dsofer), and our resident expert, [Nelson](https://github.com/nelsonic).

*How much work have we got coming in?*    
Check the projects board or come to the Friday projects meeting to find out.

*What will apprentices be paid?*    
We are a freelance co-operative. We are all self-employed. We set our own rates of pay. But we are aiming for a starting rate for apprentices of Â£10/hour.
