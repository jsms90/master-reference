#Classroom schedule  

**Start each day at 10am with a coding challenge**     
Start the day with a 30-minute paired programming session. 

**Start each week with a new project**     
And get each team to start their project with a README, user stories and failing tests.  

**Spend Monday working in roles**    
Our Jigsaw classroom day.  

**Role presentations on Monday afternoon**     
Each role group presents their research findings at the end of the day on Monday.  

**Early evening talks and pitches**     
Talks and MVP pitches generally take place at 5.30pm Tuesday to Thursday.  

**End the day by reviewing someone else's code**     
Before going home each day on Tuesday to Thursday, select a different team's project, follow the README, and leave feedback in the form of GitHub issues (if you prefer, you can review all three projects in one go, but make sure you review and leave issues on every other team's project every week).  

**Review the week's learning on Friday afternoon**     
Do a *Stop, Go, Continue* session at some point after lunch.  

**Project reviews on Friday afternoon**     
Review each team's projects as a group on Friday afternoon. The review consists of a run through of the README, a review of issues raised, running tests, a review of the code, and a presentation of the application.
