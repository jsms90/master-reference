#Projects  

**First, agree the scope**     
Before you do anything, agree the scope of the project.  

**Second, create the README**     
Next, create a repo with a README to describe the project.  

**Third, create the wireframes and user stories**     
Use Google Slides for wireframes and PivotalTracker for user stories.

**Fourth, create acceptance tests**     
Don't start work on the project until you have created a set of failing tests that reflect the user stories.
