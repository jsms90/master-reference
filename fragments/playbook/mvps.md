# MVP projects

After completion of the foundation course, students can continue with a further period of study, consisting of four projects completed over up to eight weeks.

Each project will consist of a complete minimum viable product (MVP). The first round of MVPs can be for the students' own projects or will be suggested by us. [Subsequent projects](http://foundersandcoders.org/mvp) will usually be for external clients or potential employers.

##Guidelines

### Project selection

+ After a project is posted on the MVP projects board, students can add their names to it.
+ We generally recommend teams of 2-4, with 3 usually being the ideal number.
  + Occasionally more than 4 people sign up for a single MVP. The situation normally resolves itself through conversation or people moving to other MVPs that catch their eye but as a last resort, we can draw straws for who stays on the the MVP.


### Before starting

The project team will be expected to meet with the client well in advance of starting on a project to agree the scope of the MVP and to get sign off from the client on a *minimum set of deliverables*. After the deliverables have been agreed, we will raise an invoice, which the client will usually be expected to pay before we start work.

### Process

+ Each project will normally start on a Monday.
+ Projects will usually last for one week with a minimum of two weeks between projects. 
  + **Note:** The main MVP will be 1 week (as communicated to clients) but team may want to work on them a little longer to round them off for case studies or if they are of particular interest so should _always_ give themselves 2 weeks
+ Each team will use PivotalTracker to manage the project.
+ Each project will consist of two one-week sprints.
+ The client will be invited to join the team on the first Monday to agree the scope of the project and to participate in a sprint planning meeting.
+ The client will be invited to join the team on the second Monday for a sprint review and planning meeting.
+ The client will be invited to join the team for a project review on the final day of the project.
+ It is also the team's responsibility to coach the client through the project process, especially if they have never worked with the notion of user stories and sprints before.


### UXer

+ Each team will appoint a UX lead who will work with the client to produce wireframes and user stories.
+ The UX lead will also train the client in the role of the *product owner* and the use of PivotalTracker.

### Client liaison
Each project team will appoint a client liaison, who's job it will be to communicate with the client throughout the project.    
This includes:
+ Arranging meeting times with the client.
+ Notifying the client of any changes to schedule or personnel.
+ Delegating any of these tasks if they are not available to carry them out.

### Communication

+ It is the responsibility of all team members to notify their colleagues of any changes to their own availability.

### Documentation

+ Each team will maintain a GitHub repository for the project with a README.
  + This is where a project should _start_ and the README should **always** be up to date.
+ Unless the client requests otherwise, the repo will be public. (But the repo and the README should usually not refer to the client by name to give their project some sort of anonymity.)
+ No sensitive client information should be included in the repo.
+ Each team will complete a screencast for the client to accompany the README, describing the project and how to install and use it.

### Pay

On successful completion of a project, all income received for these MVPs will be divided equally between the students. It is the responsibility of students to raise their own invoices addressed to Founders & Coders so they can be paid.

### On completion of four projects

After completion of four projects, graduate developers may decide to prepare their submission to the [apprentice panel](/journey.md). They can also continue to work on MVP projects, as they become available.

We also encourage graduates to continue with any follow-up work for the client after the completion of an MVP. This will be charged at a higher (non-MVP) rate.
