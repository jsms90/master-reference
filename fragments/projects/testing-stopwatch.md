## Project

Build a stopwatch!

**Project brief:**
- Split into your groups of 4, then pair up within that group (1 stopwatch per pair).
- Follow the TDD cycle to create a stopwatch, using ping pong.
- Before you go off and start building your stopwatch, you may want to spend couple of hours on a Technical Spike.
  - This will put you in good stead when it comes to building the stopwatch in a TDD manner.

**Stopwatch specs:**<br>

For this project you should open an issue on your project repo for each user story you task yourself to complete. The user story encompasses features of your app from a user's perspective and also includes its accompanying user acceptance criteria.

An example of a user story you might use is:

As a **software developer wanting to accurately predict how long a coding task takes to complete**
> I want to **time how long I have been working on a task**

> So that **in the future I know how much time to estimate**.

The user acceptance criteria is a list of technical tasks, described from the user's perspective, that need to be completed to fulfill the user story.

The user acceptance criteria for the above story would be:

- [ ] I can press a start button, in order to start a timer
- [ ] I can press a stop button, in order to stop the timer at how much time has passed since start
- [ ] I can press a reset button, in order to stop the timer and reset the displayed time to 00:00:00:00
- [ ] I can see the timer's current time in hours, seconds, minutes and milliseconds

**Stretch goals:**

- laps
- countdown timer
- split timer
- use BlanketJS for code coverage (Extra points for 100% code coverage!!! :wink:)
- add as much functionality as you like! (alarm, translator, speed up/slow down etc.)

**For the purpose of your learning:**
- Focus on functionality, TDD and a full set of tests before CSS.
- TDD can be painful and slow but it's a key learning objective for this week, persevere.
