## Business Development Point Person Role

Each of our campuses runs business development (final two hours of day 1 of each week) differently, based on the needs of the campus. At campuses that utilize the task group model, we suggest assigning an alumni/staff point person to each group.

**Point person responsbilities:**
- Conducting an (approximately) 15 minute stand-up with your task group on Mondays at 4 (either in person, over phone, or on Gitter)
- Provide historical context for task group
- Be available to your task group on Gitter throughout the week
- At some point in the week, respond to appropriately labeled issues (suggested 15 minutes/week)

**Task group responsibilites:**
- Check in with point person at beginning of time block
- Check out at the end of the time block and ask for any help they might need before the next time
