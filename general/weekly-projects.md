# Project

Each week, you will be split into teams of 4 by your mentors. These teams will be changed twice during the first half course, to give you a chance to work with as many other members of your cohort as possible.

The teams stay together for the following weeks:
+ First team = weeks 1-3
+ Second team = weeks 4-6
+ Third team = weeks 7-8

Your mentors will let you know which teams you will be in at the beginning of weeks: 1, 4 & 7. Have a chat with your team when it first forms, and come up with a team name.

## Creating repositories for each project
Inside your GitHub organisation you will see three repositories that have been created for you:
+ `prerequisites-gh-pages`
+ `research`
+ `morning-challenge-solutions`

When you create repositories for your weekly projects, please follow this naming convention:  
`week1-<name of team1>`  
`week1-<name of team2>`  
`week1-<name of team3>`  
`week1-<name of team4>`  

`week2-<name of team1>`  
`week2-<name of team2>`  
`week2-<name of team3>`  
`week2-<name of team4>`  

etc.

This will make it much easier to find your projects in future.

Aside from these repositories, the organisation is yours and you are free to add whatever you would like inside.

## Project Presentation

Your timetable includes 15 mins for your team to discuss how you are going to present your project together.
**Remember: We want to hear from everyone during your presentation!**

Each team then has 15 minutes to present, with 5 minutes for questions. We will be strict with you on timing, so make sure you use your planning time effectively.

### Structure
1. Show your readme:
    + Talk through the Why, What, How of your project
    + How did you split up the work?
    + How did you choose to pair?
2. Demo your website and explain how it conforms to your brief i.e. the user stories
3. Walk us through your code. Prioritise the things you learned that were new to you, which the rest of your cohort could benefit from hearing about:
    + something you're proud of
    + something that you found really hard / struggled with
