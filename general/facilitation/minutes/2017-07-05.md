## FCI Standup 
July 5, 2017

**Present:** Dan, Rebecca, Jen, Mavis, Lubes, Joudy, Elias

Dan: 
- Point of this meeting is to give us an opportunity for us all to check in
- This meeting serves as an opportunity to set an agenda for the future

London: 
- Mid-week 2
- Weeks 1-3 catchups with mentors
- Planning catchups with mentors for weeks 4-6
- Encourage students to contribute to curriculum planning by raising issues 
- Updates to workshops after London, before Nazareth - change to Week 2, Day 1 workshop
- Would like to discuss plan for pastoral care

Nazareth:
- Week 1 is going well
- Some problems with internet connectivity
- A few people came without Linux installed
- Nazareth was not sent the pre-course
- Jen reports that past cohorts had people without Linux, and that they installed themselves once they realized it was necessary
- More involvement from mentors in Nazareth and Gaza in workshop updates, for example, assigning/mentioning them on PRs
- Suggestion to create table in `master-reference` with list of mentors for each week at each campus

Gaza:
- Met with FACG1 to discuss expectations for mentorship
- Met with mentors for week 1 and reviewed `master-reference` and their week specifically
- Instructed them to review resources on their own time
- Most of the mentors are starting projects next week
- Will be giving a talk on React to FACG1 + others, interested in asking FACG1 for topic suggestions (not covered during FAC) for talks Elias could give
