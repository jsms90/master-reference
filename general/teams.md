# Student teams

**Four-student teams**    
*"With only two people on a team, there may not be a sufficient variety of ideas, skills, and approaches to problem solving for the full benefits of group work to be realized...  On the other hand, if a team has more than five members, at least one is likely to be relatively passive...Many cooperative learning authorities believe that five-member teams are likely to experience the same problem. Our recommendation is therefore to form three- and four-person teams, making more of them teams of four if early dropouts are common in the course."*  

**Diversity**     
Teams should be diverse in ability and background.

**Teams should be selected by mentors, not self selected**    
*"Mentors should form teams rather than allowing students to self-select. Left to their own devices, the stronger students in the class will tend to seek one another out... Groups containing all weak students are likely to flounder aimlessly or reinforce one anotherâ€™s misconceptions, while groups composed entirely of strong students often adopt a divide and conquer policy, parcelling out and completing different parts of the assignment individually and putting the products together without discussion."*  

Team members should not hold back from sharing ideas and insights with other teams.  

The weekly projects are not a competition. They are a learning process.
