## Nazareth - Summer Cohort Curriculum Planning 2017

+ installation party 2-3 days before the course starts
+ more time for workshops

Research:
  + Students usually copy paste and dont really understand the topic.
  + Students dont have time to go through what others researched.
  + Students presentations are not clear.
  + It could work if there are more directed questions.
  + Give list of rec resources
  + Mentor introduction to the topics
  + HOW and WHAT to present ?
  + Readmes are not the best way to present
  + Building small project with the topic in the center makes more sense
  + Was not clear how to conduct the research
  + Every research should have an example

week 1
  + Git workshop should code along
  + Git workshop should have been done on students project
  + Glossary of terms and commands for git
  + Replace accessibility workshop with CSS workshop (flexbox, media queries)
  + Combine accessibility workshop with morning challenge

Esraa note: I dont think TDD is that simple as introduced in the second week.
Lubs: Easy to understand the concept, hard to implement it
week 2
  + It will be helpful to introduce TDD with real project (Code along)
  + introduction to better layout practices/structure/design pattern (Elias workshop from week3 can be helpful here, Naz cohort didn't do it fully)
  + was not easy to understand the skeleton code

week 3
  + Parallel functions morning challenge was good
  + Elias workshop should be in week 2

week 4
  + Node Girls workshop was really good (if you finish it...give more time)
  + Tape-testing workshop is not helpful because its copy-paste
  + Make sure everyone understand what is NPM
  + Make sure everyone understand node core packages exist
  + Modularise a Node.js server morning challenge +1

week 5
  + Shot and Tape workshop can be in week 4
  + Error handling workshop required a lot of direction from mentors
  + Node Shell workshop was good and provided useful info for some students but its not clear why we teach it
  + Morning challenge - build request module +1
  + The project was smiliar to previous weeks

weeks 5 & 4 GN

  + why postgreSQL?
  + installation should be moved before day 1

  + Testing in hapi & server.inject workshop (FACN1 didnt finish the workshop becuase they didnt feel its the time for it)
  + more handlebars

  + There are things that we should know before doing OAth (basic login, session mangment, JWT)
