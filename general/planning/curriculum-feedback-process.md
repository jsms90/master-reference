# Curriculum Feedback Process

*Before the planning phase for each curriculum, there should be a period in which feedback is given by key stakeholders, alumni, and current students, and the week-by-week structure of the next curriculum is formulated.*

For course facilitators who take on this responsibility in the future, this is the process that has worked in the past.

## Workflow

*F&C follows a democratic educational model and so everyone's feedback, student or mentor, is valued.*

As there are many people involved in the feedback process, it is important that the curriculum is drafted through stages of review. First with key stakeholders, then alumni, then students, so that the feedback of each is communicated to the next.

1. Firstly, key stakeholders & course facilitators meet to formulate & draft changes to the curriculum.
2. Secondly, the draft is made available through a github issue in this repo for peer-review by alumni. The curriculum draft is updated to reflect the consensus of their peer-review.
3. Lastly, a curriculum feedback day is run with the current students at the end of the taught part of the curriculum. Their feedback on the draft is given, the broad week-by-week structure is finalised, and students are assigned as mentors to weeks.

## Curriculum feedback day

The following is a broad outline of the student's curriculum feedback day. The facilitator's overall aim of the day should be to finalise the week-by-week structure of the curriculum, based upon student and prior feedback, as all other issues can be resolved at a later date.

**Morning**

*The morning is focused on giving students a chance to express their own feedback on the curriculum.*

* Introductory talk on the curriculum planning process & the outline for the day. Question & answer.
* Get each student to come up with two areas of improvement (stop, go) to the curriculum
to write on post-its and stick to the wall. This limitation is important to focus each person
on what is most important to them, and so that every student gets an equal opportunity to share.
* Discuss each of the improvements as a group. Any notes that are duplicates or related by theme should be grouped together. Once finished, write up each theme of their improvements onto a whiteboard with their notes attached for later in the afternoon.

**Afternoon**

*The afternoon is focused on reviewing the curriculum draft and contrasting it against their feedback.*

* Introduce the curriculum draft to the students with the rationale for the changes made, and let them read and consider it. Stick to the wall a post-it for general feedback and one for each week of the curriculum. Then, if they have any issues, get the students to raise them as post-its next to the relevant week.
* Discuss each of the issues raised and group them by theme or existing themes if any are related. Leave any issue that is specific to a week next to that week's post-it, to be later translated into that week's github issue.
* Go through each of the themes from the morning, and if any are resolved by the curriculum draft then take them down. Try to reach a resolution on as many as is feasible. Then write up each new theme from the review onto the whiteboard with their notes attached.
* The whiteboard should now have on it all the unresolved themes raised by the students for the day. Get every student to rank them in terms of priority. Give each student three high priority votes to mark against themes in one colour, and six middle priority votes to mark against themes in another. This is purely for facilitators to get a sense of the consensus of the group and what needs to be prioritised.
* Provided the week-by-week structure is finalised, write up each week on the board and let the students assign themselves to each week for mentoring. Three per week. Conclude by updating them on the next steps.

## Converting feedback into github issues

All feedback should be translated into github issues in this repo so that they can be actioned upon.

* An issue should be created in this repo for each assigned week of the curriculum, as a single source for mentors to discuss their weeks, commit their plans against, and for external review.  Summaries of the post-it feedback and s-g-c notes specific to that week should be included within it so mentors know how their cohort wants them to improve their week. The appropriate F&Cn label should be given to the issue for archiving purposes, and it should be assigned to the appropriate mentors. Each issue can be closed once the week is delivered and its stop-go-continue notes have been recorded.
* Any important themes raised by stakeholders, alumni or students that are unresolved should be converted into issues in this repo so they can be discussed further. Once a theme is resolved it can be closed.

For further guidance, you can use [this issue](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/issues/18) that was created as an example of the overall curriculum feedback process. It was used for F&C10's curriculum planning and contains navigation to the issues for the alumni peer review, each of the curriculum weeks, and each of the themes that were raised during feedback.
