# Creation of resources

Following the vision of Founders and Coders, the `master-reference` uses exclusively open source content. In true open source fashion, we don't want to duplicate effort. So we expect our students to use and improve on what has gone before them, before thinking about creating new material.

However, on a course that is undergoing continuous iterative improvements, it is natural to occasionally experience larger-scale alterations to a particular week. Sometimes even to the whole curriculum. In which case, new material may be preferable.

Whenever we do create new material, it is then our responsibility to facilitate future improvements in every way possible. We start by clearing up any questions around ownership and ongoing maintenance of these new resources.

Authors of new material must choose one of the following options:

| Option | Owner | Maintainer |
|--------|:------|:-----------|
| 1 | `foundersandcoders` | TBC (someone else in the FAC community) |
| 2 | `foundersandcoders` | original author |
| 3 |   original author   | original author |

### Forking from the `foundersandcoders` version
You will all have learned how to [fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) in Week 1 of the course. Forks should be created _from_ the version in `foundersandcoders`, _to_ your profile. If your workshop is still in your profile, first [transfer](#transfers) it to the `foundersandcoders` organisation.

If you just want to give Founders and Coders a copy to use (because you don't mind us using the material, but you don't want the original to receive updates from students), please create a [mirror](#mirrors) instead.

### FAQs

#### What does being a maintainer entail?

Please make sure that you follow these open source guides on [Best Practices for Maintainers](https://opensource.guide/best-practices/) & [Building a Community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/).  

Maintainers should expect spikes in contribution during the following weeks in each campus:
+ the week that contains their repo
+ curriculum planning week
