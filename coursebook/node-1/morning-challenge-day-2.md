## Morning challenge - day 2

Clone the [Morning challenge: Convert ES6 code to ES5](https://github.com/stevehopkinson/es6-challenge.git) repository to your computer and follow the instructions.

A completed solution is saved in the solutions directory of the repository, but try to work it out yourself first â€“ it's not a race, and you shouldn't worry if you don't manage to complete everything.
