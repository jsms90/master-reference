## Day 4 Running Order

### Today is Prototyping Day

**Today is also preparing for Testing Day**

### The Prototype Mindset

**You gotta believe!**

You must believe that no matter the task you can prototype it.
All you need to build is a realistic façade that is something that you can put in front of your customers, get their reactions, and get answers to your questions.

**Goldilocks quality**

Create a prototype with just enough quality to evoke honest reactions from your users.

**Pick the Right Tools**

When you’re building “a dumb prototype” you might find that it’s inappropriate to use any high-end paid-for software that you might otherwise use to make wireframes. In order to move fast enough to reach your end goal, it might be a better choice to go for something a little simpler.

We are **non-prescriptive** in terms of medium and software

- **with code** - HTML, CSS Frameworks, JS, jQuery
- **paid for software** - axure, omnigraffle, sketch, photoshop (word of advice - web apps are not yet competitive e.g. mockflow, proto.io)
- **free software** - powerpoint, google slides, balsamiq, figma, inVision
- **no software at all** - scissors, paper, pens

We recommend [figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [inVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for mobile apps.

### Divide and Conquer

Making a whole working testable prototype in one day is a pretty mammoth task.
There are ways you can divide the job to make it easier!

Don’t let just one person be responsible for making everything beginning to end.

**Elect the following:**

- Maker
  - Primary wireframe builder
  - Secondary wireframe builder - You can break your storyboard into smaller scenes and assign each to different team members.
- Writer
  - All copy - whether reassuring, explaining, promoting, warning or whatever
  - Checking all copy
  - Tone of voice - legibility, comprehension, clarity
- Asset Collector
  - All images, logos, characters, sprites etc.
- Stitcher
  - Sometimes things can fall ‘out of place’
  - It is the job of the stitcher to make sure every screen and interaction comes together and makes sense as a whole.
- Human Test Subject Recruiter
  - Who are you going to put this face of
  - Time?
  - Place?
  - Conditions and running order

### About 3pm - 4pm

#### Trial Run

Run through the prototype **together as a team**.

*Try to get this done before the end of the day because you might need to go back and change something.*

#### Are you Ready for Testing
- Do you know all of the equipment / setup you will need?

**Think of it in these terms:**

- You have identified a problem you believe can be solved.
- You have identified a potential solution to that problem.
- Your solution is your carefully designed hypothesis.
- How are you going to test that hypothesis?
- How are you going to record the results of that test?
