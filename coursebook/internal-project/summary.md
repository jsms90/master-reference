## Outline

## Introduction

These weeks are to be run in a way that emphasises peer-led learning.

Students should be made aware **the week before** that the learning environment is going to change.
Students will be expected to
- determine what they need to know to achieve their learning outcomes
- do all of their own research in to the relevant areas
- plan all of their own exercises
- ask a facilitator for help when all other avenues have been exhausted

This section of the course is three weeks long. In groups of between 2-4 people, you will build a product over two sprints, choosing your own tech stack and following scrum.
Each project will allow you to further one or more of the following aims: build a product that you care about; learn entrepreneurial skills; and learn new technologies that will directly impact your employability.

## Objectives
  - Learn technologies you feel will help you in the hiring process.
  - By creating or extending `readme`'s, contribute to the community's learning resources. Teams which uses a technology that is not part of the curriculum are expected to document their learning. This can be done by contributing to an existing DWYL / FAC readme, or by creating a new one where one does not exist.
  - Have time to work on a project you care about. Throughout the selection process, we encourage students to come to the space with their own idea for furthering social good (in any given sector). We want to give you the time and support you need in order to build something.
  - learn about UX, product development and scrum.
  - learn about about user testing. Since you will have time to build something quite proper, this will be a great time to try and do some **real** user testing.
