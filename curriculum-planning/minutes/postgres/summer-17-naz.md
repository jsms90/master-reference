## general
Shireen, Yvonne: went really well

## Day 1

### Walkthrough
Yvonne: Shireen and Zooey did really good job

### installation
Yvonne: why not just install psql during installation party?
Lubes: why not install it the weekend before?
Zooey: people who had problems were those less comfortable with their linux systems.\
Yvonne: agree for FACN3, should install beforehand
Suha: have office hours on Sunday morning to help those that didn't manage to install.
Zooey: there's better troubleshooting documentation coming soon.

**AP: get people to install it the week before, raise issue on MR week 4**

**AP: have office hours on Sunday morning w6**

**AP: Stefano should raise issues documenting how he solved his issue**

**AP: document all problems**

### intro commands workshop
some people didn't do it bcos installation
Yvonne: not a big deal, it's all in the next workshop.
Yvonne: but those who have installation problems are probably those who might have more problems picking up the stuff.

### SQL commands and psql
Generally good.
Suha: main problem this week with workshops was timing. Not that people don't get stuff, just not enough time.
Zooey: makes sense, do as much as you can is a good format for a workshop
Lubes: sometimes there is really important stuff people don't get to

**Zooey: generally, I recommend being really strict on timing.**
Lubes: sometimes if you feel something is less important, you could cut into that time
Zooey: make sure it's the mentors making that decision, not the students.

## Day 2

### Walkthrough
Lubes: went on for 2.5 hours, can't be sped up at all.
Yvonne, Suha: was good, and important.
Lubes: I felt this codealong had too much to write before actually running anything.
Lubes: was good recommending them to write their own comments
Shireen: have some files ready, some have to be coded-along

**AP: lubes raise issues on the workshop maybe**

### Workshop
Suha: was good because of the code-along, but they asked a lot of questions, but they 20/20/20'd well
Suha: timing maybe an issue

### Aside 
Zooey: had a moment of 'why are you asking me this? you should be debugging this yourself'
Yvonne: depends on philosophy of mentoring, should we be teachers or is it more peer-led?
Lubes: improvements need to be made in curriculum
Yvonne: they need to trust each other more
Zooey: maybe try to enforce 20/20/20 more, they need to rely on themselves more, especially as we near the 2nd half of the course
Suha: we should agree as mentors beforehand how much help to give, maybe workshop specific (e.g. fine in codealong), as students will just ask the next mentor, damn them!
Zooey: workshops, agree, let people struggle a bit more, less mentors in the room
Yvonne: sometimes goes off to research a student's questions on her own, and they fix it when she returns...

**AP: enforce 20/20/20, and call them out for not researching it**

### Research
we dropped testing.
and had less time, as workshop ran over
Yvonne: script injection was quite important, but maybe not done that well
Suha, Zooey: script injection should be covered elsewhere
Yvonne: this week was much worse than last week's fun projects

## Day 3

### morning challenge
Suha: was good, even had a student demonstating at the front of the class and a lively discussion
Mario: we only did the first task
Zooey: maybe change the 3rs to optional extra stretch
Generally went well

## projects
generally going ok
Zooey: most questions related to setup, not SQL
